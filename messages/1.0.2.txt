=================================
UnrealScript IDE has been updated
=================================

New Stuff:
----------

* **Performance increase**
	* This comes with a downside of performance decrease at startup, but after startup it will be much faster

* **Classes auto-completion**
	* classes do now also appear in the completions list.
	* especially helpful in the class declaration line when you are thinking about what class to extend.

* **Object-oriented go to declaration support**
	* e.g. activating goto declaration over controller.GetPlayerViewPoint(a, b) will take you to the declaration of GetPlayerViewPoint in Controller
	* typecasting is not yet supported.

Object-oriented Auto-completion is coming soon!!!
